# StudyFlashCards

This a personal project that I developed to help me studying English Vocabulary. The program displays a Flask screen that shows an image that represents a front of a studying flashcard. 

One of the card's side has the english vocabulary and the other the word translated to Spanish.

How it works:

- First you need to run the command: python ./main.py
- Then the program will show a random card with the english word on it.
- After 3 seconds the program will flip the card over showing the word in Spanish
- Finally, when you click for closing the tab the program will make a .csv file with the words you couldn't remember.

# Dependencies
- Pandas: for getting the words from a .csv file an making a new one when the program is over
- Flask: used for the GUI
